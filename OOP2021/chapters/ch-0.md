# Differences between Procedural and Object Oriented Programming
First, what is a **programming paradigm?** It is a style of programming, a way of thinking about software construction. A programming paradigm does not refer to a specific language but rather to a way to program, a methodology. Some languages make it easy to write in some paradigms but not others. For more details, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm).

**Procedural Programming:**
*Procedural Programming* can be defined as a programming model which is derived from *structured programming*, based upon the concept of calling *procedure*. Procedures, also known as *routines*, *subroutines* or *functions*, simply consist of a series of computational steps to be carried out. During a programâ€™s execution, any given procedure might be called at any point, including by other procedures or itself.

Languages used in Procedural Programming:

FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL, 
BASIC, Pascal and C. 

**Object Oriented Programming:**
*Object oriented programming* can be defined as a programming model which is based upon the concept of *objects*. **Objects** contain *data* in the form of *attributes* and *code* in the form of *methods*. In object oriented programming, computer programs are designed using the concept of objects that interact with real world. Object oriented programming languages are various but the most popular ones are *class-based*, meaning that objects are *instances* of classes, which also determine their types.

Languages used in Object Oriented Programming:

Java, C++, C#, Python, 
PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, 
Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala. 


**Difference between Procedural Programming and Object Oriented Programming:
**

|Procedural Oriented Programming|	Object Oriented Programming|
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
|In procedural programming, program is divided into small parts called **functions**.	|In object oriented programming, program is divided into small parts called **objects**.|
|Procedural programming follows **top-down approach**.|	Object oriented programming follows **bottom-up approach**.|
|There is no access specifier in procedural programming.|	Object oriented programming have access specifiers like private, public, protected etc.|
|Adding new data and function is not easy.|	Adding new data and function is easy.|
|Procedural programming does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is less secure.|	Object oriented programming provides data hiding so it is more secure.|
|In procedural programming, overloading is not possible.|	Overloading is possible in object oriented programming.|
|In procedural programming, function is more important than data.|	In object oriented programming, data is more important than function.|
|Procedural programming is based on unreal world.|	Object oriented programming is based on real world.|
|Examples: C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic etc.|	Examples: C++, Java, Python, C# etc.|
