1. Draw Class Diagram and Develop code for a class named as *Arithmetic* with an Insatance variable `num` and instance method `factorial()` for finding the factorial of a number. 
1. Expand the class *Arithmetic* with a method to swap two numbers without using temporary variable. Explore the different ways in which the above task can be performed.
1. Expand the class *Arithmetic* with a method to perform the sum of digits of a number.
1. Draw a Class Diagram and Develop code for *Cuboid* class with 3 static variables `length`, `breadth` and `height` of type *float*, and a static method `volume ()` to calculate volume of the Cuboid, access them using main () method within the same class.
1. Write a Cuboid class with 3 static variables length, breadth and height of type double, and a static method volume (), access them using main () method within another class Demo.
1. Write a class named *Circle* with radius as a static member and two static methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle. Draw the class diagram.
1. Expand the class Arithmetic with a method to check if a given number is prime or non-prime.
1. Write a class named *Rectangle* with static members `length`, `width` and a method which will compute the `area` of a rectangle.

1. Suppose you save $100 each month into a saving account the annual interest rate 5%. Thus, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12=0.00417. After the first month the value in the account becomes `100 * (1+0.00417) = 100.417`. After the second month the value in the account becomes `(100+100.417) * (1+0.00417) = 201.252` and so on. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and display the amount value after 6 months. 
2. Write a program that reads three co-ordinates of a triangle and compute the perimeter if the input is valid otherwise display the input is invalid. The input is valid if the sum of every pair of two edges greater than remaining edge.
3. Expand the class Arithmetic with a method to return `TRUE` if the year is leap year else return `FALSE` using static method. Modularize to method, class, and package level.
