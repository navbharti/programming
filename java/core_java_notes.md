Parts of java language :

Generally there is no core java and advanced java in java.

As per the sun micro system standard the java language is divided into three types.

1) J2SE/JSE(java 2 standard edition)
2) J2EE/JEE(java 2 enterprise edition)
3) J2ME/JME(java 2 micro edition)

J2SE:-

By using j2se we are able to develop the standalone applications.

`Ex`:- notepad, WordPad, paint, Google Talk etc.

Standalone applications:-

1) Standalone applications are the java applications which don’t need the client server architecture.

2) The standalone applications applicable for the only one desktop hence it is called
desktop applications or window based applications.

J2EE:-

By using j2ee we are able to develop the web based applications.

`Ex`:- Gmail, yahoo mail, bank, reservation…………etc

Web-applications:-

1) Web applications are the java applications which needs client and server concept.
2) Web applications must need the internet connections to access the application.

J2ME:-

By using j2me we are able to develop the applications that applications only run on mobile devices.

Differences between c, cpp and java :

|S no | C language | Cpp language | Java language|
|---|------------|-------------|-----------------|
|1 |The program execution starts from main method and main method is called by Operating system. | The program execution starts from main method called by operating system. | The program execution starts from main method called by JVM (java virtual machile).|
|2 |In the c-language the predefined support is maintained in the form of header files Ex:- stdio.h,conio.h |In the cpp language the predefined is maintained in the form of header files. Ex:- iostream.h |In the java language the predefined is maintained in the form of packages. Ex:- java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.awt |
|3 |the header files contains predefined functions. Ex:- printf,scanf | The header files contains predefined functions. Ex:- cout,cin | The packages contains predefined classes. Ex:- String,System |
|4 |To make available predefined support into our program we have to use #include statement. Ex:- ```#include<stdio.h>```  |To make available predefined support into our program we have to use ```#include``` statement. Ex:- ```#include<iostream>``` | To make available predefined support into our program we have to use ```import``` statement. Ex:- ```import java.lang.*;```
