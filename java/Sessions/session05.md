# Session Five: Modularization and access specifiers

## 1. Apply modularization – Method and class level Modularization. 
## 2. Understand the usage of access specifiers – public, private and default.
    
```
Write a Cuboid class with 3 static variables `length`, `breadth` and `height` of type double, and a static method volume(), access them using main() method within the same class.
```

## need of a class as a template

## (Encapsulate data and methods)
## Syntax – Define a class

## Modularize the above Cuboid class.

```
Write a Cuboid class with 3 static variables length, breadth and height of type double, and a static method volume (), access them using main () method within another class Demo.
```

## usage of access modifiers – private and public

```
Rewrite the Cuboid class with appropriate access specifiers
